# Balancing-Rover-Project

#This design details an autonomous Mars rover capable of mapping an unknown arena. The rover makes use of a suite of sensors to determine its position with respect to the arena walls and a camera for detection of six ‘aliens’ that must be identified. The rover integrates several subsystems which interface to a main microcontroller that controls the rover’s movement.
